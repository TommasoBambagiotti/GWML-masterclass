# GWML-masterclass

This repository contains materials for the advanced class "Big Data within Science and Industry," which will take place on September 22, 2023, at the University of Milano-Bicocca in Milan, Italy.

**Class Information:** [Big Data within Science and Industry](https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/bigdatamasterclassTutorials)

## Overview

In this class, you will find notebooks and resources for:

- Gravitational Wave (GW) data preprocessing.
- Machine Learning applications.

We will be implementing a test case to classify transient signals for different mechanisms of GW emission by Core Collapse Supernovae (CCSN) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## Requirements

Before you start, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

### Python Environment

You need to have a Python environment with the necessary packages installed. If you do not have the environment on your PC, you can set it up by following these instructions:

1. Install a Python environment on your notebook. For Windows:
   - Connect to [Anaconda Installation Guide](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/windows/).
   - Download the installer from [Anaconda Downloads](https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2023.07-2-Windows-x86_64.exe).

3. Once installed, you can launch a Jupyter Notebook.

### Required Packages

You will need to install specific packages required for the tasks to be solved. You can do this by running the following commands in a Jupyter Notebook cell:

```python
!pip install gwpy
!pip install statsmodels
!pip install tensorflow
!pip install scikit-learn
